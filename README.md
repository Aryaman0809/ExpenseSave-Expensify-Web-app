## Overview

Many individuals lack financial freedom, and this stems from poor spending skills. As a result, we wanted to create something to help prevent that. We realized how difficult it can be to track the expenses of each individual person in a family. As humans, we tend to lose track of what we purchase and spend money on. Inspired, we wanted to create an app that stops all that by allowing individuals to strengthen their organization and budgeting skills.

ExpenSave is an expense tracker website targeting households and individuals with the aim of easing peopleâ€™s lives while also allowing them to gain essential skills. 

The website has two key components:

Dashboard : Main dashboard for all users showing user and category-wise details

Cash Flow Report : A detailed analysis of user's spendingd with visualisations made using Chart.js for the same. It also has an option for adding expenses using a deatiled form
